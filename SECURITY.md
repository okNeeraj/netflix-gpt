## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |


### New features

New features will only be added to the master branch and will not be made available in point releases.

### Bug fixes

Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. When enough bugs are fixed and its deemed worthy to release a new gem, this is the branch it happens from.

### Security issues

Only the latest release series will receive patches and new versions in case of a security issue.

### Severe security issues

For severe security issues we will provide new versions as above, and also the last major release series will receive patches and new versions. The classification of the security issue is judged by the core team.

### Unsupported Release Series

When a release series is no longer supported, it's your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Do not create a public GitHub issue. Security issues are sensitive, and we want to ensure they are handled appropriately.
2. Contact us privately via email at [okneerajsingh@gmail.com].
3. Provide as much information as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue. This may include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any potential mitigations.
4. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

We appreciate your help in keeping the Netflix-GPT project secure.
